# Project32
> A compact yet powerful and flexible C++ Game Engine designed for modern development needs with multi-engine and multi-window support.

<img width="1867" height="794" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d51802bc-d74a-4aed-8aad-952f2f2aadc7" />

## ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION
> **This project is currently under active development.** Many features are incomplete or subject to change. Use at your own risk for production applications.

## 🦀 RUST REWRITE IN PROGRESS
> **This project is being rewritten from the ground up in Rust.**
> The original C++ codebase will remain here for reference, but all active development has moved to the Rust rewrite.
> The new version preserves the same design intent and identity as the original — rebuilt layer by layer as independent libraries.
> **Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and significant structural differences from the C++ version.**

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Engine Architecture**: Run multiple independent engine instances simultaneously
- **Multi-Window Support**: Each engine can manage multiple windows with independent rendering contexts
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API and comprehensive documentation *(Work in Progress)*
- **Hot-Reload Ready**: DLL-based architecture enables dynamic loading and reloading
- **Extensible**: Modular design allows for easy customization
- **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability
- **Self-Contained**: All dependencies included in the repository

## 📋 Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows *(macOS and Linux support coming soon)*
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- **C++ Standard**: C++20 or later
- **Dependencies**: Everything is included in the repository - no external setup required!

## 🛠️ Installation and Building
### Quick Method
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Retroboi64/Project32.git
# Navigate to project directory
cd Project32/Project32
# Open solution file
start Project32.sln
# After Visual Studio opens: Build → Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
```

### Alternative Method
1. Open **Visual Studio 2022**
2. **File** → **Open** → **Project/Solution**
3. Navigate to `Project32/Project32/Project32.sln`
4. **Build** → **Build Solution (Debug/Release — Only x64 is supported)** (or press **Ctrl+Shift+B**)

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Game Development: Build games with multiple viewport support
- Editor Tools: Create Unity/Unreal-style multi-window editors
- Simulation Software: Run multiple simulations simultaneously
- Debugging Tools: Split game and debug views into separate windows
- Multi-Monitor Setups: Leverage multiple displays effectively

## 🏗️ Architecture
### Multi-Engine System
Project32's unique multi-engine architecture allows you to:
- Run multiple independent engines in the same process
-  Each engine has its own window manager and render context
- Engines can run simultaneously or be controlled individually
- Perfect for complex editor scenarios or multi-view applications

### API Layers
- C API: Core exported functions for DLL interaction
- C++ Wrapper: RAII-style P32::Engine namespace for modern C++
- Instance Classes: EngineInstance and WindowInstance for object-oriented usage
